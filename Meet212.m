% representation of images in magnitude and phase
% generate filters so that when you take real image generates 
% complex magnitudes.  

% Choose to group every 4 phases 
% Data set for which any place in the image for which there are coherence,
% we can see coefficients and only send one phase

% Go see test values is the main goal
