%% Plot various positions of the edge vs. 

% Grand question: can we understand the relationships between phases of the
% around a filtered edge.  

% Low Passing the Gaussian filter
% Explain one number (let's look at phase)
% Locally linear
% Take edge pick sample calculate phase
% Complex multiplication offset...
